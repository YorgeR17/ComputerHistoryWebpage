<center><h1>Computing History</h1></center>
<p>
    My essay is on the history of computing from the early 1960s through the 1990s, more specifically the technology of the early games during that time. During that time computer game programing was starting to become popular because the coding language PDP-1 was created. Some of the games created include Spacewar, Pong and the Atari system.

    Spacewar was created by Steve Russell in 1962 it took six weeks to make and develop. The way to play Spacewar consists of two monochrome spaceships called "the needle" and "the wedge", each controlled by a player, attempting to shoot one another while maneuvering on a two-dimensional plane in the gravity well of a star, set against the backdrop of a starfield. The ships fire torpedoes, which are not affected by the gravitational pull of the star. The ships have a limited number of torpedoes and a limited supply of fuel, which is used when the player fires his thrusters. Torpedoes are fired one at a time by flipping a toggle switch on the computer or pressing a button on the control pad, and there is a cooldown period between launches. The ships follow Newtonian physics, remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating. Each player controls one of the ships and must attempt to shoot down the other ship while avoiding a collision with the star. Flying near the star can provide a gravity assist to the player at the risk of misjudging the trajectory and falling into the star. If a ship moves past one edge of the screen, it reappears on the other side in a wraparound effect. A hyperspace feature, or "panic button", can be used as a last-ditch means to evade enemy torpedoes by moving the player's ship to another location on the screen after disappearing for a few seconds, but the reentry from hyperspace occurs at a random location, and in some versions there is an increasing probability of the ship exploding with each use. If the player's ship explodes it's game over.

    Next is the game of Pong which was created in 1972 with the Atari system. Pong was  one of the earliest arcade video games and the very first sports arcade video game. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. While other arcade video games such as Computer Space came before it, Pong was one of the first video games to get really popular. The point of the game is to defeat an opponent by earning a higher score. The game was originally manufactured by Atari. Allan Alcorn created Pong as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari.

    Lastly, Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by many people since it began in 1972. It is currently owned by Atari Interactive, a partner of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and gaming industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.
    In 1984, the original Atari Inc. was split due to its role in the video game crash of 1983, and the arcade division was turned into Atari Games Inc. Atari Games received the rights to use the logo and brand name with the text "Games" on arcade games, as well as rights to the original 1972â€“1984 arcade hardware properties. The Atari Consumer Electronics Division properties were in turn sold to Jack Tramiel's Tramel Technology Ltd., which then renamed itself to Atari Corporation.

    In conclusion there were a lot of fun old video games such as Pong, Spacewar and Atari.  Compared to today's video games the ones during early 1960s through the 1990s where simple yet very innovated and made way for future video games.
